# 2D-Shape-Prediction

ðŸ“Œ **Status:** This is a paper in progress. Below is a rough overview of what has been done so far.

This project explores forecasting the evolution of a 2D shape over time using radial sampling and time-series prediction techniques.

### Workflow Overview

âœ… **Step 1 â€“ Simulate Shape Evolution:**  
I manually created circular layers, each expanding slightly each year to simulate shape evolution over time.

âœ… **Step 2 â€“ Extract Centroid and Generate Radial Lines:**  
Calculated the centroid of the first-year shape and created radial lines in 1-degree increments to cover the full circular boundary.

âœ… **Step 3 â€“ Intersect Shapes with Radial Lines:**  
Performed an intersection of each shape with the radial lines to extract geometry at each angle.  <img width="1162" height="699" alt="3  intersection lines" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c9c040e-4e25-4e71-a7d8-5ff84fd1ebfc" />

âœ… **Step 4 â€“ Predict Future Endpoints:**  
Using the intersection data, a forecasting model (Prophet) was applied to predict the future endpoints of the shape after learning the historical increment pattern.
